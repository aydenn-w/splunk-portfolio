# splunk-portfolio
Full Hands-on Splunk analysis projects: SSH, HTTP, Zeek, and Unauthorized Access investigations.
A complete hands-on collection of Splunk projects focused on real-world security analysis. 

## ðŸ“š Overview
This 7-Day Splunk lab series demonstrates how to deploy Splunk, parse and filter logs, and investigate realistic attack scenarios.

| Day | Project Title | Focus |
|-----|----------------|--------|
| Day 1â€“2 | [Install and Configure Splunk] | Installed and configured Splunk Enterprise on Ubuntu to collect and visualize system logs. |
| Day 3 | [Splunk SSH Log Analysis] | Detected brute-force SSH login attempts using event correlation and filtering queries. |
| Day 4 | [Splunk HTTP Log Analysis] | Analyzed web server logs to find unusual HTTP traffic patterns and failed requests. |
| Day 5 | [Splunk Zeek Connection Analysis] | Used Zeek connection logs to uncover potential reconnaissance and network anomalies. |
| Day 6 | [Splunk Investigating Unauthorized Access] | Identified brute-force attack signatures and attacker IPs through repeated login failures. |
| Day 7 | [Splunk Investigating SSH Brute Force Attack] | Traced unauthorized access attempts through correlated authentication events. |
